I intend to learn and explore the concepts and procedures taught in this introductory Wilcox book. Please keep in mind that my writing is just a kind of training exercise for me. There will be no new insights presented, and as I am still learning the basics of R and statistics, you may find misunderstandings and errors in my writings. For authoritative reference, you have the consult the original book: Rand, W. (2017).
