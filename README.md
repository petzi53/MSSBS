# MSSBS

MSSBS stands for "Modern Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences", a book by Rand Wilcox. The book your are reading here are my excerpts and notes on the practical introduction by Wilcox, which focuses on the open source software R.

My intention is to learn and explore the concepts and procedures taught from this introductory book. Please keep in mind that my book is just a kind of a training exercise for me. There will be no new insights presented and as I am still learning the basics of R and statistics you may find minsunderstandings and errors in my writings. For authoritative reference you have the consult the original book: Rand, W. (2017).
